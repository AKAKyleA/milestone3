                    <p>Marmora Hardware, a local hardware store located in Marmora, New Jersey, has been providing quality products and exceptional customer service for over 70 years. It all began as Corsons hardware, a small family-owned business that started in the early 1950s. The hardware store was known for its vast selection of hardware products and its reputation for providing personalized service to the local community.</p>
<br>
<p>Over the years, the hardware store continued to thrive, gaining loyal customers who valued the store's commitment to quality and personalized service. The store remained a family-owned business, and the Corsons family worked tirelessly to maintain their reputation as a trusted and reliable source for all hardware needs.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2010, Christopher Antolini took over ownership of the hardware store, and it was then renamed Marmora Hardware. Antolini, a local businessman, saw the potential of the hardware store and was committed to preserving its legacy. He believed in providing excellent customer service and ensuring that the store offered a vast selection of quality products at affordable prices.</p>
<br>
<p>Mike Ricchi manages the hardware store, and together with Antolini, they have continued to build on the store's reputation for providing excellent customer service and offering quality products. They have expanded the store's selection of products to include everything from tools and hardware to lawn and garden supplies, paint, and home improvement items.</p>
<br>
<p>Today, Marmora Hardware is a well-respected and trusted business in the local community. The store has grown over the years, but it has maintained its commitment to providing personalized service and quality products at affordable prices. Customers can trust that they will always find what they need at Marmora Hardware, and they can rely on the knowledgeable and friendly staff to help them with any questions or concerns they may have. Marmora Hardware is more than just a hardware store; it is a local institution that has become an essential part of the community.</p>
